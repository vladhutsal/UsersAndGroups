### UsersAndGroups_Django
CRUD application to create and handle users and groups relations in a table view.

There was the task, that should be completed and started with docker-compose.yml, so I created two containers - the first one runs Django backend, the second one - runs ReactJS frontend, via 'yarn start' (to start the dedicated node server)

### How to start?
#### 1. Clone repository to your machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/vladhutsal/UsersAndGroups_DjangoReact.git
```
#### 2. Open terminal in your local repo folder and run (for Linux with docker-compose installed):
```
docker-compose up
```

#### 3. Open your browser and visit:
```
localhost:3000
```
